                        <p>The bowl has more food (or at least it feels that way).</p>
                        <p>The cups are to small so I would go up a size</p>
                        <h5>Review</h5>
                        <p>Panda Express is a well know fast-food chain in the United States. Selling yummy entrees and sides that can be mixed and matched, you can have a multitude of different dishes every time you order. The Panda Express is a must while being on UNCG's campus.</p>

One of my favorite sauces on chicken would have to be teriyaki sauce and this entree is no exception. The grilled teriyaki is my second favorite entree. The first is to the right.</p>
                                <p class="desc8 hide">My second recommendation is the Orange Chicken. This is the most well know product on the menu and it does not disappoint. When you have this orange chicken you will understand why it is everyone's number one choice. including mine!</p>
                                <p class="desc9 hide">My third recommendation is the Honey Walnut Shrimp. I know what you are thinking could the shrimp be good. Well, no it is not good, it is scrumptious. It is one of my new favorites and one I hope you try. The only thing is that it cost $1.25 more on top of anything you order.</p>

                                <p class="desc10 hide">My first recommendation is the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. This spicy spin on the original is sure to make you sweat. When added with mayonnaise it is sure to get your mouth watering. And if you don't like spice the original is always an option.</p>
                                <p class="desc11 hide">My second recommendation is the 12 count chicken nuggets. This is my go-to when I do not know what I want. My favorite sauce to pair it with is Chick-Fl-A sauce. And even though an 8 count is the same you just feel fuller with a 12 count.</p>
                                <p class="desc12 hide">My third recommendation is the Cobb salad. You may be saying isn't ordering salad at a fast-food restaurant like eating fish at a steak house? And my answer to that question is yes, but Chick-Fl-A is the exception. I have never had a gross salad from Chick-Fl-A and hopefully I never will. I have recommended the Cobb salad because it is my favorite, but truly all the salads are delicious.</p>
